Deploy to Testnet: Run zk config, which will walk you through adding a network alias to your projectâ€™s config.json. 
For Berkeley Testnet, we recommend using berkeley as the name, 0.1 for the fee, and https://proxy.berkeley.minaexplorer.com/graphql for the url. 
Then run zk deploy and follow the prompts. See the [how to deploy a zkApp] (how-to-deploy-a-zkapp) page for further details.
